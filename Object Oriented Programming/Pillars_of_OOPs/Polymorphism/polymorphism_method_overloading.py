"""Polymorphism is based on the greek words Poly (many) and morphism (forms). We will create a structure that can
take or use many forms of objects. Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (
data types). Example 1: The student can act as a student in college, act as a player on the ground,
and as a daughter/brother in the home. Example 2: In the programming language, the + operator, acts as a
concatenation and arithmetic addition. Example 3: If we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape options (
rectangle, square, circle). However we could use the same method to color any shape.z
